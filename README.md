# Computer Networks Routing Algorithms Learning Tool

This is an educational interactive tool designed to help students better understand routing algorithms. 
With our tool, users can create a network and explore two distinct routing algorithms ( Centralized and Decentralized Algorithms). 
Our user-friendly interface provides students with an improved visualization experience, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of routing algorithm concepts.
